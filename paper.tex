In this paper, we will discuss abstract Fourier analysis on arbitrary groups, in

groups and of compact groups.

\section{Conclusion}

The theory Fourier of analysis was long developed throughout the history: it was
first developed in $16$th century to study the physical phenomenon of vibration
of strings and to solve partial differential equations associated with it.  It
later became one of the core problems in analysis and relates to varies areas of
mathematics.  For example, it has relates intimately to the representation
theory on compact groups as we have explored in this paper.

In fact, if we put more restriction on the case we studied and let $G$ be a
compact \emph{abelian} group (of which $\T$ still is one archetypal example),
there is an even more remarkable symmetry between representation theory and
Fourier analysis: characters of $G$ form an orthonormal basis of $L^2(G)$ and
Fourier Transform and Fourier inversion formulas gives an isomorphism between
$G$ and the dual group $\hat{G}$ of its characters.

% Fourier analysis was studied extensively in the $20$th century and
% remains a


% \section{Categorified Fourier Analysis}

% \begin{thm}
%   The category of representations of group $G$ is equivalent to the category of
%   vector spaces parametrized by the dual group $\hat{G}$ of characters.
